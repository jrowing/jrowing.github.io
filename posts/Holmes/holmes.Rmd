This evening I'm watching a Sherlock Holmes adaptation and my mind turns to the interconnectedness of all of the tales. I wonder if it's possible to apply a graphical rendering to the collected works...

... It turns out that the Sherlock Holmes story network is a fascinating way to visualize the relationships between characters, stories, settings, and themes in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective canon. By imagining the stories as nodes in a graph and connecting them by shared elements, we can explore how the world of Holmes is intricately interwoven.

Here’s a breakdown of the main elements in such a network:

## Key Nodes in the Network

### 1. Central Character Node

Sherlock Holmes is the hub. He appears in nearly every story.
Connected to: Every case, Dr. Watson, clients, villains, Scotland Yard, and locations.

### 2. Dr. John Watson

Holmes’ companion and chronicler.
Present in most stories, especially earlier ones.
His medical background and moral compass balance Holmes’ deductive detachment.

### 3. Recurring Supporting Characters

Mycroft Holmes – Sherlock’s brilliant but lazy brother.
Inspector Lestrade, Gregson, Hopkins – Scotland Yard detectives.
Mrs. Hudson – Holmes’ landlady.
Professor Moriarty – Criminal mastermind, Holmes’ arch-nemesis.
Irene Adler – “The Woman,” only appears once but has lasting impact.

### 4. Stories as Nodes

There are 60 stories (56 short stories, 4 novels):
Novels: A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear
Collections include: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs, The Return, His Last Bow, The Case-Book, etc.

### 5. Villains

Some are connected to multiple stories (e.g., Moriarty is mentioned across a few).
Others are one-offs but memorable (Dr. Roylott in Speckled Band, Jonathan Small in Sign of the Four).

### 6. Settings

* 221B Baker Street – Always home base.
* London – Primary playground for urban mysteries.
* English countryside – Many rural cases, e.g., The Copper Beeches, Hound of the Baskervilles.
* International elements – Some stories link to India, the US, Andaman Islands, etc.

## Connections in the Network
Story to character (e.g., The Speckled Band → Dr. Roylott)
Story to location (e.g., The Hound of the Baskervilles → Baskerville Hall)
Character to character (e.g., Holmes ↔ Moriarty)
Theme links (e.g., inheritance disputes, revenge, justice, deception)

## Why Map This Network?
Educational: Great for literature analysis or classroom discussion.
Fun for fans: Spot patterns and hidden relationships.
Computational analysis: You can apply network science to study centrality (Holmes wins!), clustering, or the evolution of story arcs.

Here's the plot:

## Breaking down an individual story:

Having plotted the cannon I wonder if there are equivalent ways to lay out the stories. It seems a shame to reduce the twists and turns of the plot to a clear graphic, however;
1 - It's an intellectual idea for fun
2 - I'm experimenting with what's possible
3 - It might give a new, different, glimpse at a favourite old story.

Here's how one can represent a Sherlock Holmes sequence diagram using Mermaid in an R Markdown document. This example shows a simplified sequence of investigation in one of the classic stories, The Adventure of the Speckled Band...
