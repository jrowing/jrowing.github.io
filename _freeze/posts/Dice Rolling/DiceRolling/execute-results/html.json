On every \"roll\" (i.e., time step), each die has a fixed probability \\( p = \\frac{1}{6} \\) of decaying (being removed). We begin with 80 dice.\n\nThis setup mimics **radioactive decay**, where:\n- The probability of a single atom decaying per unit time is constant.\n- The number of undecayed atoms decreases over time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Required libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Parameters\nP0 <- 80\nn_rolls <- 50\np <- 1 / 6\n\n# Simulation\npop_avg <- numeric(n_rolls + 1)\nset.seed(NULL)\n\nP <- P0\npop_avg[1] <- P0\nk <- 1\nwhile (k <= n_rolls && P > 0) {\n  r <- rbinom(1, P, p)\n  P <- P - r\n  pop_avg[k + 1] <- P\n  k <- k + 1\n}\n\n# Truncate data when population hits zero\nfinal_index <- which(pop_avg == 0)[1]\nif (is.na(final_index)) {\n  final_index <- length(pop_avg)\n}\npop_avg <- pop_avg[1:final_index]\ntime <- 0:(length(pop_avg) - 1)\n\n# Exponential decay model\nlambda <- -log(1 - p)\nexp_model <- P0 * exp(-lambda * time)\n\n# Geometric approximation\ngeometric_expansion <- function(t, p, P0, n_terms = 15) {\n  sapply(t, function(tt) {\n    sum(sapply(0:(n_terms - 1), function(k) {\n      coef <- (-1)^k * choose(tt, k)\n      coef * p^k\n    })) * P0\n  })\n}\ngeom_approx <- geometric_expansion(time, p, P0, n_terms = 15)\n\n# Half-life\nt_half <- log(2) / lambda\n\n# Combine data\ndf <- data.frame(\n  Roll = time,\n  Experimental = pop_avg,\n  Exponential = exp_model,\n  Geometric = geom_approx\n)\n\n# Plot\nggplot(df, aes(x = Roll)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Experimental, color = \"Experimental (Simulated)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Exponential, color = \"Exponential Decay (Continuous)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Geometric, color = \"Geometric Expansion (15 terms)\"), linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = t_half, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"purple\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = P0 / 2, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"purple\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = t_half + 1, y = P0 / 2 + 3, label = \"Half-life\", color = \"purple\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Radioactive Decay with Half-life Marker\",\n    x = \"Roll Number\", y = \"Dice Remaining\",\n    color = \"Legend\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](DiceRolling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## What‚Äôs Plotted?\n\nThe graph shows three curves:\n\n### 1. Experimental (Simulated) Line\n- This line shows the actual number of dice remaining after each roll in a single experiment.\n- It's jagged because it's **random**: on each roll, a different number of dice decay.\n\n### 2. Exponential Decay Line (Continuous Model)\n- This is the smooth curve you'd get if decay happened continuously (instead of once per roll).\n- It's based on the exponential decay formula:  \n  \\[\n  N(t) = N_0 e^{-\\lambda t}, \\quad \\lambda = -\\ln(1 - p)\n  \\]\n- This is often taught as the **theoretical decay law** in physics.\n\n> üîç This curve smooths out randomness and assumes infinitesimally small time steps ‚Äî great for math, but not realistic for real-world random events.\n\n### 3. Geometric Expansion Line (Dashed)\n- This is a **series approximation** of the geometric decay:  \n  \\[\n  N(t) = N_0 (1 - p)^t\n  \\]\n- The series is built using the **binomial expansion** of \\( (1 - p)^t \\), and you‚Äôve included 15 terms for good accuracy even at early times.\n- This curve lies right on top of the exponential line for small \\( t \\), showing they‚Äôre nearly equivalent at first.\n\n\n## What the Graph Shows You\n\n- **Agreement at Early Times:** All three lines start at the same place and follow a similar shape, showing how well the continuous exponential model approximates the actual discrete decay early on.\n- **Divergence Through Randomness:** The experimental line starts to diverge due to the random nature of decay (especially in single trials).\n- **Geometric vs Exponential:** The geometric expansion sits between the raw simulation and the smooth exponential, acting as a bridge between theory and simulation.\n\n\n\n## Physics Context\n\nThis graph is a perfect classroom tool to:\n- Introduce **exponential decay** and how it's derived.\n- Highlight the assumptions behind the exponential model (e.g., continuous time).\n- Show how **probabilistic events lead to deterministic laws** when averaged or modeled.\n- Provide a **critical look at models** ‚Äî the \"perfect curve\" doesn‚Äôt represent any single real-world trial, but rather an average over many.\n\n",
