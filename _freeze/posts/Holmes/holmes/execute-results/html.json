I wonder if it's possible to apply a graphical rendering to the collected works...\n\n... It turns out that the Sherlock Holmes story network is a fascinating way to visualize the relationships between characters, stories, settings, and themes in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's detective canon. By imagining the stories as nodes in a graph and connecting them by shared elements, we can explore how the world of Holmes is intricately interwoven.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the main elements in such a network:\n\n## Key Nodes in the Network\n\n### 1. Central Character Node\n\nSherlock Holmes is the hub. He appears in nearly every story.\nConnected to: Every case, Dr. Watson, clients, villains, Scotland Yard, and locations.\n\n### 2. Dr. John Watson\n\nHolmes’ companion and chronicler.\nPresent in most stories, especially earlier ones.\nHis medical background and moral compass balance Holmes’ deductive detachment.\n\n### 3. Recurring Supporting Characters\n\nMycroft Holmes – Sherlock’s brilliant but lazy brother.\nInspector Lestrade, Gregson, Hopkins – Scotland Yard detectives.\nMrs. Hudson – Holmes’ landlady.\nProfessor Moriarty – Criminal mastermind, Holmes’ arch-nemesis.\nIrene Adler – “The Woman,” only appears once but has lasting impact.\n\n### 4. Stories as Nodes\n\nThere are 60 stories (56 short stories, 4 novels):\nNovels: A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, The Valley of Fear\nCollections include: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs, The Return, His Last Bow, The Case-Book, etc.\n\n### 5. Villains\n\nSome are connected to multiple stories (e.g., Moriarty is mentioned across a few).\nOthers are one-offs but memorable (Dr. Roylott in Speckled Band, Jonathan Small in Sign of the Four).\n\n### 6. Settings\n\n* 221B Baker Street – Always home base.\n* London – Primary playground for urban mysteries.\n* English countryside – Many rural cases, e.g., The Copper Beeches, Hound of the Baskervilles.\n* International elements – Some stories link to India, the US, Andaman Islands, etc.\n\n## Connections in the Network\nStory to character (e.g., The Speckled Band → Dr. Roylott)\nStory to location (e.g., The Hound of the Baskervilles → Baskerville Hall)\nCharacter to character (e.g., Holmes ↔ Moriarty)\nTheme links (e.g., inheritance disputes, revenge, justice, deception)\n\n## Why Map This Network?\nEducational: Great for literature analysis or classroom discussion.\nFun for fans: Spot patterns and hidden relationships.\nComputational analysis: You can apply network science to study centrality (Holmes wins!), clustering, or the evolution of story arcs.\n\nHere's the plot:\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\ngraph TD\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> B[The Hound of the Baskervilles]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> C[The Adventure of the Speckled Band]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> D[The Sign of the Four]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> E[The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> F[The Final Problem]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> G[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> H[The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> I[The Adventure of the Priory School]\n    A[Sherlock Holmes] --> J[The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet]\n\n    B --> K[Dr. Watson]\n    C --> K\n    D --> K\n    E --> K\n    F --> K\n    G --> K\n    H --> K\n    I --> K\n    J --> K\n\n    K --> L[Villain: Dr. Grimesby Roylott]\n    K --> M[Villain: Jonathan Small]\n    K --> N[Villain: Charles Augustus Milverton]\n    K --> O[Villain: Professor Moriarty]\n    K --> P[Villain: John Hector McFarlane]\n    K --> Q[Villain: Hugo Baskerville]\n    K --> R[Villain: Charles Baskerville]\n\n    B --> S[Setting: Baskerville Hall]\n    C --> T[Setting: Stoke Moran]\n    D --> U[Setting: The Andaman Islands]\n    E --> V[Setting: London]\n    F --> W[Setting: Reichenbach Falls]\n    G --> X[Setting: Musgrave Manor]\n    H --> Y[Setting: The Engineer’s Workshop]\n    I --> Z[Setting: The Priory School]\n    J --> AA[Setting: The Jewelers' Shop]\n\n    L --> AB[Death of Helen Stoner]\n    M --> AC[The Hunt for the Treasure]\n    N --> AD[Blackmail Plot]\n    O --> AE[Reichenbach Falls Death]\n    P --> AF[Inheritance Conspiracy]\n    Q --> AG[Hound Mystery]\n    R --> AH[Baskerville Family Curse]\n\n    S --> AI[The Hound of the Baskervilles]\n    T --> AJ[The Poisonous Snake]\n    U --> AK[Treasure Hunt]\n    V --> AL[The Blue Carbuncle]\n    W --> AM[Holmes and Moriarty's Final Confrontation]\n    X --> AN[Musgrave's Ritual]\n    Y --> AO[The Engineer's Dilemma]\n    Z --> AP[The Missing Schoolboy]\n    AA --> AQ[The Robbery of the Beryl Coronet]\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Breaking down an individual story:\n\nHaving plotted the cannon I wonder if there are equivalent ways to lay out the stories. It seems a shame to reduce the twists and turns of the plot to a clear graphic, however;\n1 - It's an intellectual idea for fun\n2 - I'm experimenting with what's possible\n3 - It might give a new, different, glimpse at a favourite old story.\n\nHere's how one can represent a Sherlock Holmes sequence diagram using Mermaid in an R Markdown document. This example shows a simplified sequence of investigation in one of the classic stories, The Adventure of the Speckled Band...\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Helen as Helen Stoner\n    participant Holmes as Sherlock Holmes\n    participant Watson as Dr. Watson\n    participant Roylott as Dr. Roylott\n    participant Inspector as Inspector\n\n    Helen->>Holmes: Requests help for her sister's mysterious death\n    Holmes->>Watson: Summarizes the case\n    Holmes->>Helen: Asks detailed questions\n    Helen->>Holmes: Mentions whistle and metallic sound\n    Holmes->>Roylott: Receives visit and threat\n    Holmes->>Watson: Decides to investigate Stoke Moran\n    Holmes->>Helen: Plans to stay hidden in her room\n    Roylott->>Helen: Sends her to sleep in her old room\n    Holmes->>Roylott: Waits with Watson overnight\n    Roylott->>Holmes: Releases snake through ventilator\n    Holmes->>Snake: Strikes it with a cane\n    Snake->>Roylott: Returns and bites Roylott\n    Roylott-->>X: Dies from snake bite\n    Holmes->>Inspector: Explains the events\n```\n",
