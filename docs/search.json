    "text": "If you‚Äôre learning about nuclear physics, chances are you‚Äôve come across three seemingly similar terms: the strong force, the nuclear force, and the Yukawa potential. They all sound like they‚Äôre doing the same thing ‚Äî holding atoms together ‚Äî but they operate at different layers of the physical universe. Here‚Äôs how they relate and why they matter.\n\n\nThe strong force (also called the strong interaction) is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, alongside gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak force.\nThis is the force that: - Binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons. - Keeps protons and neutrons bound inside the atomic nucleus.\nIt‚Äôs described by a theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which uses particles called gluons to mediate the interaction between quarks.\nüß† Analogy: Think of the strong force as the glue that holds the bricks (quarks) together to build the walls (protons and neutrons) of the atomic structure.\n\n\n\nThe nuclear force (or residual strong force) is what acts between whole protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons).\nHere‚Äôs the catch: protons and neutrons are made of quarks, which interact via the strong force. But this interaction ‚Äúleaks out‚Äù beyond the boundaries of each nucleon, creating a residual force ‚Äî the nuclear force ‚Äî that binds nucleons together into stable nuclei.\nüìè The nuclear force only acts at very short ranges (around 1 to 2 femtometers, or (10^{-15}) meters), which is why nuclear reactions require extremely close encounters.\nüß† Analogy: If the strong force is like the electrical bonding within molecules, the nuclear force is like van der Waals forces between those molecules ‚Äî a residual effect with a big impact.\n\n\n\nIn 1935, physicist Hideki Yukawa proposed a mathematical model of the nuclear force. His theory suggested the force was mediated by a new, short-lived particle ‚Äî what we now know as the pion (œÄ-meson).\nHe derived a formula to describe how the potential energy between two nucleons changes with distance:\n[ V(r) = - e^{-r / r_0} ]\nWhere: - ( V(r) ) is the potential energy at distance ( r ) - ( g ) is a coupling constant (strength of interaction) - ( r_0 ) is the characteristic range of the force (about 1.4 fm) - The exponential term causes the force to drop off quickly with distance\nThe Yukawa potential gives us a simple, classical approximation of how nucleons interact. It was the first successful model of the nuclear force, and it earned Yukawa the Nobel Prize.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding these forces is crucial for: - Explaining nuclear fusion and fission - Modeling atomic nuclei - Designing particle accelerators and nuclear reactors - Exploring the origins of matter in the early universe\nWhile the full theory (QCD) is mathematically intense, the Yukawa potential gives us a beautifully simple way to model complex interactions ‚Äî perfect for simulations, teaching, and exploring the basics of nuclear physics.\nHere‚Äôs how you can model the strong nuclear force in R using the Yukawa potential;\n‚úÖ R Code: Yukawa Potential and Force\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Constants\ng &lt;- 1         # arbitrary coupling strength\nr0 &lt;- 1.4      # range of strong force in femtometers\n\n# Distance range (in femtometers)\nr &lt;- seq(0.01, 1, length.out = 500)\n\n# Yukawa potential (V) and force (F = -dV/dr)\nV &lt;- -g^2 * exp(-r / r0) / r\nF &lt;- g^2 * exp(-r / r0) * (1 + r / r0) / r^2\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(r = r, Potential = V, Force = F)\n\n# Plot potential\np1 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = r, y = Potential)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkred\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Yukawa Potential (Strong Force)\", x = \"Distance r (fm)\", y = \"Potential Energy V(r)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n# Plot force\np2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = r, y = Force)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"darkblue\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Strong Force vs Distance\", x = \"Distance r (fm)\", y = \"Force F(r)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n# Print plots\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential plot shows a sharp dip near ( r = 1 ) fm ‚Äî strong attraction!\nThe force plot shows the force peaks at ~0.7‚Äì1.2 fm and rapidly decays after that.\n\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Constants\ng &lt;- 1                   # Yukawa coupling (arbitrary units)\nr0 &lt;- 1.4                # Range of strong force (fm)\nk_e &lt;- 1.44              # Coulomb constant in MeV¬∑fm (e¬≤ / (4œÄŒµ‚ÇÄ) in nuclear units)\nZ1 &lt;- 1                  # Charge of proton 1\nZ2 &lt;- 1                  # Charge of proton 2\n\n# Distance range in femtometers (avoid r = 0 to prevent division by zero)\nr &lt;- seq(0.1, 2, length.out = 500)\n\n# Potentials\nV_strong &lt;- -g^2 * exp(-r / r0) / r\nV_coulomb &lt;- k_e * Z1 * Z2 / r\nV_total &lt;- V_strong + V_coulomb\n\n# Create data frame\ndf &lt;- data.frame(\n  r = r,\n  `Strong Force` = V_strong,\n  `Coulomb Repulsion` = V_coulomb,\n  `Total Potential` = V_total\n)\n\n# Melt for ggplot\nlibrary(reshape2)\ndf_melted &lt;- melt(df, id.vars = \"r\", variable.name = \"Type\", value.name = \"Potential\")\n\n# Plot all potentials on the same graph\nggplot(df_melted, aes(x = r, y = Potential, color = Type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Proton-Proton Interaction Potentials\",\n       x = \"Distance r (fm)\",\n       y = \"Potential Energy (MeV)\",\n       color = \"Interaction\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs break down the Yukawa + Coulomb Potential graph, especially in the context of two protons interacting (like in a fusion reaction).\n\n\n\nThe x-axis is: - Distance between the protons, in femtometers (fm).\n( 1 = 10^{-15} ), about the size of a nucleus.\nThe y-axis is: - Potential energy (MeV) ‚Äî the energy required to bring two protons to that separation.\n\n\n\n\nShown as: Red curve\nEquation:\n[ V_{}(r) = - e^{-r/r_0} ]\nAttractive at short distances (under ~2 fm)\nShort-ranged ‚Äî drops off quickly beyond ~2‚Äì3 fm\nOriginates from meson exchange in quantum field theory\nPulls nucleons together inside the nucleus\n\n\n\n\n\nShown as: Blue curve\nEquation: [ V_{}(r) = ]\nRepulsive between two like charges (protons)\nActs at all distances, strongest when the protons are close\nPrevents them from getting near each other\n\n\n\n\n\nSum of the two: [ V_{}(r) = V_{}(r) + V_{}(r) ]\nShape:\n\nHigh repulsive barrier at medium distances (from Coulomb)\nThen dips sharply negative at short range (strong force attraction)\nShows a potential well if you overcome the Coulomb barrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nuclear fusion, two protons must get close enough (‚â§ 1‚Äì2 fm) for the strong force to take over and bind them.\nBut the Coulomb barrier resists this ‚Äî classically, they‚Äôd bounce off.\nQuantum tunneling allows them to penetrate the barrier even if they don‚Äôt have enough energy classically ‚Äî this is how fusion happens in the Sun!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction\nNature\nRange\nEffect\n\n\n\n\nCoulomb\nRepulsive\nLong-range\nPushes protons apart\n\n\nStrong (Yukawa)\nAttractive\nShort-range\nPulls protons together when very close\n\n\nTotal Potential\nCombo\nMixed\nCreates a fusion ‚Äúbarrier‚Äù and potential well"

    "title": "What Did BirdNET-Pi Hear Last Month? Insights from Our smart bird identifier",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the last month, our BirdNET-Pi setup has been busy eavesdropping on the avian soundscape around our garden. This low-cost device has been collecting acoustic data non-stop. Here‚Äôs what we have learned so far‚Ä¶\n\nWhat is BirdNET-Pi?\nBirdNET-Pi is a powerful, open-source device designed to automatically identify bird species based on their calls. It uses advanced machine learning models to analyze audio recordings and classify the sounds, distinguishing between different bird species with remarkable accuracy. Built around the Raspberry Pi platform, BirdNET-Pi is a compact and affordable solution for anyone interested in birdwatching, conservation, or wildlife monitoring.\nAt its core, BirdNET-Pi consists of a microphone for recording bird calls, a Raspberry Pi computer to process the audio, and software that leverages a machine learning model trained on thousands of bird calls. The system continuously listens to the environment, making it capable of capturing sounds at all hours of the day and night, including those of rare or hard-to-find species.\nBirdNET-Pi‚Äôs ability to identify birds based on their calls is a valuable tool for researchers, conservationists, and bird enthusiasts alike. It provides a hands-free, automated way to monitor bird populations, track species diversity, and gather important ecological data, all while being incredibly easy to set up and use. Whether placed in a backyard, nature reserve, or forest, BirdNET-Pi acts as an ever-vigilant listener, expanding the possibilities of birdwatching and species monitoring.\n\n\nHow BirdNET-Pi Increases the Chances of Detecting Rare Species\nBirdNET-Pi‚Äôs constant listening capability is a game-changer when it comes to identifying rare or elusive bird species. Traditional methods of birdwatching or audio recording often rely on scheduled observation times, which can miss the fleeting moments when rare species make an appearance. However, BirdNET-Pi‚Äôs unique advantage lies in its 24/7 monitoring.\nBy continuously recording and analyzing bird calls in real-time, BirdNET-Pi increases the likelihood of capturing rare or seldom-heard species that might otherwise go unnoticed. Birds often have distinct, infrequent calls that occur during specific times of the day or seasons. Because BirdNET-Pi is always listening, it‚Äôs far more likely to catch these brief, sporadic vocalizations when they happen.\nThis proactive approach not only ensures that rare species have a better chance of being detected, but it also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of bird populations and behaviors. By capturing these rare moments, BirdNET-Pi allows for better conservation efforts and more accurate ecological data, helping researchers and bird enthusiasts alike stay one step ahead in their birdwatching pursuits.\n\n\nMonitoring the March Soundscape\nThroughout March, our BirdNET-Pi detected thousands of bird calls, logging them with species names, time stamps, and confidence scores. After cleaning and analysing the data from our SQLite database, I‚Äôve picked out the top 25 most frequently detected bird species and visualised their activity by hour of day‚Ä¶\n\n\nShow the code\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"birds.db\")\n\n# Read detections table\ndetections &lt;- dbReadTable(con, \"detections\")\n\n# Get top 25 species by detection count\ntop_species &lt;- detections %&gt;%\n  count(Com_Name, sort = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 25) %&gt;%\n  pull(Com_Name)\n\n# Filter to top species and extract hour\ndetections_top &lt;- detections %&gt;%\n  filter(Com_Name %in% top_species) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Hour = hour(hms(Time)))\n\n# Count detections by hour for each species\nhourly_counts &lt;- detections_top %&gt;%\n  group_by(Com_Name, Hour) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot\nggplot(hourly_counts, aes(x = Hour, y = Count)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Com_Name, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(strip.clip = \"off\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top 25 Bird Species: Detections by Time of Day\",\n       x = \"Hour of Day\",\n       y = \"Number of Detections\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this tells us so far:\n\n1. Morning is Bird Prime Time\nMost species showed a clear peak in vocal activity between 5:00 and 9:00 AM. This aligns with the well-known ‚Äúdawn chorus‚Äù and confirms that early morning is the most active period for birdsong in our area.\n\n\n2. Some Birds Buck the Trend\nA few species, like the Common Wood-Pigeon, showed more spread-out activity throughout the day. Others, such as woodpeckers, had sharper, time-specific peaks, often in the mid-morning. Owls, it would appear like the early hours more than late at night, Guls tend to swing by about 3pm.\n\n\n3. Detectability Matters\nNot all species were equally common. This much is obvious, however there will be a factor of how easy they are to detect. Some had consistently low hourly counts, suggesting rarity, quieter behaviour or limitations in acoustic identification. These species might benefit from targeted surveys or manual verification.\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nUnderstanding when different species are most vocal helps refine survey methods, targeted monitoring, and even conservation planning. For backyard birders, it‚Äôs also a reminder: if you want to catch the action, get out early!\nWe‚Äôll continue to log, listen, and learn as spring progresses. If you‚Äôre running BirdNET-Pi yourself, consider checking your hourly patterns too‚Äîyou might be surprised by who‚Äôs been chatting while you weren‚Äôt watching.\nHappy birding!"

A Highly Eccentric Orbit + Precessing Axis\n\nThe planet‚Äôs orbit around its sun is a long ellipse, not a circle.\nSometimes it‚Äôs much closer to the sun, sometimes far.\nThe axis also precesses (wobbles), shifting the timing of the seasons.\n\nThis could cause a planet-wide long winter if the coldest part of orbit coincides with a tilted-away axis.\n\n\n\n2. Chaotic Binary Star System\n\nThis is my favourite one but it really wouldnt last very long before the planet crashed into one of the suns\n\n\nImagine two suns pulling on the planet.\nThe orbit gets subtly, unpredictably warped over time.\nDistance to the primary sun changes, making summers hotter or colder.\n\nThis could create ‚ÄúThe Long Heat‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Fading‚Äù ‚Äî seasons with no fixed schedule.\n\n\n3. Variable Axial Tilt\n\nThe planet‚Äôs tilt changes over decades due to interactions with a massive moon or nearby planets.\nWhen the tilt is strong: extreme seasons.\nWhen it‚Äôs mild: barely any seasons.\n\nIf tilt gets stuck near zero, the planet could have long, uniform seasons that shift slowly over years.\n\n\n4. Passing Rogue Planet or Dark Star\n\nEvery few centuries, a rogue planet or companion star swings by.\nIt nudges the planet‚Äôs orbit just slightly ‚Äî but the result is chaotic, long-term changes in season lengths.\n\nPerhaps the Dark One‚Äôs prison isn‚Äôt just metaphorical ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs an euphamism for a dark star that actually perturbs the planet‚Äôs orbit.\n\n\n5. Magical Cosmic Influence\n\nLet‚Äôs not rule out magic ‚Äî but give it structure.\nMaybe there‚Äôs an invisible celestial body in higher dimensions that exerts a gravitational ‚Äúpulse.‚Äù\nThis pulse could rhythmically stretch or compress seasons‚Ä¶ or tie them to the Turning of the Wheel."

    "text": "Creating a 90-ball bingo card can be challenging because of several key rules and requirements that must be followed, including the distribution of numbers, the uniqueness of each row, and ensuring a balanced and fair game. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs particularly tricky:\n\nFixed Number Range per Column In 90-ball bingo, there are 90 possible numbers, ranging from 1 to 90. The card consists of 3 rows and 9 columns, with each column corresponding to a specific range of numbers:\n\nColumn 1: Numbers 1‚Äì9\nColumn 2: Numbers 10‚Äì19\nColumn 3: Numbers 20‚Äì29\nAnd so on until‚Ä¶\nColumn 9: Numbers 80‚Äì90\nThe challenge comes from the need to distribute the numbers across the 9 columns so that:\nEach column contains a random selection of numbers from the correct range.\nThe total number of numbers in the card is limited (i.e., each row contains only 5 numbers and each column contains exactly 3 numbers).\n\nEnsuring No Duplicates Each bingo card must be unique ‚Äî no two cards can have the same number in the same place. This means that not only do we need to distribute the numbers according to the column ranges, but we also have to ensure that across multiple cards, the number placement is randomized without repeating the exact same pattern.\nEach Row Must Contain 5 Numbers A 90-ball bingo card has 3 rows and 9 columns, but only 5 numbers per row. This means that in each row, there will be some empty cells (spots with no numbers). The challenge is to:\n\nEnsure that the numbers are spread out across the entire row while keeping the 5-number constraint.\nMaintain a consistent structure across multiple cards.\n\nEnsuring Fair Distribution For the game to be fair, numbers should be distributed as evenly as possible across the 9 columns. This means ensuring that there are no biases, such as certain columns being overly dense with numbers or others being too sparse. The balancing between columns is vital to prevent players from having an unfair advantage.\nRandomization While bingo cards are created with specific rules for how numbers are placed, there is still a randomness aspect involved. Ensuring that every generated card adheres to the required constraints (e.g., 3 numbers per column, 5 numbers per row) while still being unique and random adds an additional layer of complexity.\nMaintaining Consistency with Game Rules 90-ball bingo has 3 types of wins: line, two lines, and full house. Ensuring that the card layout doesn‚Äôt favor one type of win over another or create any unintentional patterns adds to the challenge of card creation.\n\nThis is my effort:\n\ngenerate_bingo_card &lt;- function() {\n  # Define column ranges\n  col_ranges &lt;- list(\n    1:9, 10:19, 20:29, 30:39, 40:49,\n    50:59, 60:69, 70:79, 80:90\n  )\n  \n  repeat {\n    # Create an empty card with NA values\n    card &lt;- matrix(NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 9)\n    positions &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = 3, ncol = 9)\n    \n    # Step 1: Randomly assign 5 filled positions per row\n    for (i in 1:3) {\n      positions[i, sample(1:9, 5)] &lt;- 1\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Ensure every column has at least one number\n    cols_with_numbers &lt;- colSums(positions)\n    if (all(cols_with_numbers &gt; 0)) break\n  }\n\n  # Step 3: Fill in numbers from correct column ranges\n  for (col in 1:9) {\n    n_numbers &lt;- sum(positions[, col])\n    numbers &lt;- sort(sample(col_ranges[[col]], n_numbers))\n    rows &lt;- which(positions[, col] == 1)\n    for (i in seq_along(rows)) {\n      card[rows[i], col] &lt;- numbers[i]\n    }\n  }\n  \n  card\n}\n\nformat_bingo_card &lt;- function(card) {\n  apply(card, 1, function(row) {\n    paste(sprintf(\"%2s\", ifelse(is.na(row), \".\", row)), collapse = \" \")\n  })\n}\n\ngenerate_and_save_bingo_cards &lt;- function(n_cards = 5, filename = \"bingo_tickets.txt\") {\n  lines &lt;- c()\n  for (i in 1:n_cards) {\n    card &lt;- generate_bingo_card()\n    lines &lt;- c(lines, sprintf(\"Card %d:\", i))\n    lines &lt;- c(lines, format_bingo_card(card))\n    lines &lt;- c(lines, \"\")  # Blank line between cards\n  }\n  writeLines(lines, con = filename)\n  message(\"Bingo cards saved to \", filename)\n}\n\n# Run it\nset.seed(42)\ngenerate_and_save_bingo_cards(n_cards = 5)\n\nBingo cards saved to bingo_tickets.txt\n\n\nCard 1: 1 17 25 . . 51 61 . . . . . 33 45 54 63 71 . . 19 27 39 . . . 77 82\nCard 2: 8 10 . . 48 . 62 74 . . 14 . 33 . 53 . 75 84 . 18 26 . 49 58 . 77 .\nCard 3: . . 29 37 40 52 . 75 . 1 . . 39 44 . 60 . 84 5 16 . . 48 58 . . 87\nCard 4: 1 10 . . . . 63 79 80 . 12 29 30 . . 69 . 83 . 14 . 34 42 55 . . 89\nCard 5: 1 . 20 38 45 53 . . . 4 15 . . . 55 66 75 . 9 17 25 . 49 . . . 89"

    "text": "When studying other galaxies it is invariably found that the stellar rotational velocity remains constant, or ‚Äúflat‚Äù, with increasing distance away from the galactic center. This result is highly counterintuitive since, based on Newton‚Äôs law of gravity, the rotational velocity would steadily decrease for stars further away from the galactic center.\nAnalogously, inner planets within the Solar System travel more quickly about the Sun than do the outer planets (e.g.¬†the Earth travels around the sun at about 100,000 km/hr while Saturn, which is further out, travels at only one third this speed). One way to speed up the outer planets would be to add more mass to the solar system, between the planets. By the same argument the flat galactic rotation curves seem to suggest that each galaxy is surrounded by significant amounts of dark matter. It has been postulated,and generally accepted, that the dark matter would have to be located in a massive, roughly spherical halo enshrouding each galaxy.\nThe first real surprise in the study of dark matter lay in the outermost parts of galaxies, known as galaxy halos. Here there is negligible luminosity, yet there are occasional orbiting gas clouds which allow one to measure rotation speeds and distances. The rotation speed is found not to decrease with increasing distance from the galactic center, implying that the mass distribution of the galaxy cannot be concentrated, like the light distribution. The mass must continue to increase: since the rotation speed satisfies v¬≤=GM/r, where M is the mass within radius r, we infer that M increases proportionally to r. This rise appears to stop at about 50kpc, where halos appear to be truncated. We infer that the mass-to-luminosity ratio of the galaxy, including its disk halo, is about 5 times larger than estimated for the luminous inner region, or equal to about 50.\nOne of the lovely things about the internet and the openness of science is that you can look at datasets like this one‚Ä¶.\nGalaxies Rotation Curves‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäDataset‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäB2FIND (eudat.eu)\n‚Ä¶and plot the data yourself:\n\n\nShow the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ndata_dir &lt;- \"data\"\n\nfiles &lt;- list.files(data_dir, pattern = \"\\\\.data$\", full.names = TRUE)\nfiles &lt;- files[!grepl(\"summary|__MACOSX\", files)]\n\nread_rotation_curve &lt;- function(file) {\n  lines &lt;- readLines(file)\n  lines &lt;- lines[grepl(\"[0-9]\", lines)]\n  \n  data &lt;- str_match(lines, \"\\\\s*([-+]?\\\\d*\\\\.?\\\\d+)\\\\s+([-+]?\\\\d*\\\\.?\\\\d+)\\\\s+([-+]?\\\\d*\\\\.?\\\\d+)\")\n  data &lt;- data.frame(data[, 2:4], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n  colnames(data) &lt;- c(\"radius_raw\", \"velocity_raw\", \"uncertainty\")\n\n  data %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(radius_raw) & !is.na(velocity_raw)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      radius = abs(as.numeric(radius_raw)),\n      velocity = abs(as.numeric(velocity_raw)),\n      uncertainty = as.numeric(uncertainty),\n      galaxy = tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(file))\n    ) %&gt;%\n    select(radius, velocity, uncertainty, galaxy)\n}\n\nall_data &lt;- map_dfr(files, read_rotation_curve)\n\n# Theoretical rotation curve: solid body (v ‚àù r) up to r_bulge, then v ‚àù 1/sqrt(r)\nr_vals &lt;- seq(min(all_data$radius), max(all_data$radius), length.out = 300)\nr_bulge &lt;- 5     # kpc - adjust based on typical bulge size\nv_max &lt;- 200     # max velocity at the bulge\n\nv_theory &lt;- ifelse(\n  r_vals &lt; r_bulge,\n  v_max * (r_vals / r_bulge),  # solid-body\n  v_max * sqrt(r_bulge / r_vals)  # Keplerian fall-off\n)\n\ntheory_df &lt;- data.frame(radius = r_vals, velocity = v_theory)\n\n# Plot\np &lt;- ggplot(all_data, aes(x = radius, y = velocity, color = galaxy, group = galaxy)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\", span = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(data = theory_df, aes(x = radius, y = velocity), inherit.aes = FALSE,\n            linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Galaxy Rotation Curves with Theoretical Classical Curve\",\n    x = \"Radius (kpc)\",\n    y = \"Velocity (km/s)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(p) %&gt;%\n  layout(legend = list(title = list(text = \"&lt;b&gt;Galaxy&lt;/b&gt;\")))"

    "section": "What is a Confidence Score?",
    "text": "What is a Confidence Score?\nIn the world of machine learning and AI, a confidence score is a number (usually between 0 and 1) that tells us how certain the model is that it has made the right prediction. In the case of BirdNET-Pi, this means: How sure is the system that the bird call it detected belongs to a particular species?\nIf the system hears a song and assigns a confidence score of 0.94 to a Great Tit, it‚Äôs very confident. If it gives only 0.72 for a Goldfinch, it‚Äôs not so sure.\nThese scores are not random‚Äîthey‚Äôre derived from deep learning models trained on thousands of real bird vocalizations. But even the best models have limits, especially in real-world environments full of overlapping calls, wind, rain, or traffic noise.\nBefore we dig into the BirdNET data specifically, let‚Äôs briefly detour into statistics. A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from sample data, that likely contains the true value we care about.\nSay you‚Äôre measuring the average height of sparrows in your garden. You might find a mean of 16 cm, with a 95% confidence interval of [15.7 cm, 16.3 cm]. That means you can be 95% sure the true average falls in that range. It‚Äôs a way of expressing uncertainty‚Äîand it‚Äôs a concept that‚Äôs related (though not identical) to BirdNET‚Äôs confidence scores.\nWhile BirdNET doesn‚Äôt give us formal ‚Äúconfidence intervals,‚Äù the distribution of scores across many detections acts like one. That‚Äôs where graphs like the one I generated become useful."

Here‚Äôs what it revealed:\n\nSpecies like the Eurasian Jackdaw and White Wagtail consistently scored high, often above 0.9. The AI model is highly confident when it hears them.\nOthers, like the Ring-necked Pheasant or Great Spotted Woodpecker, had wider spreads and lower medians‚Äîsuggesting the model struggled more with these. There is some evidence that birds have local accents and I wonder if these are coming into play.\nSome species had lots of outliers, hinting at inconsistent recordings or background noise.\n\nThis plot is powerful because it helps me do three things:\n\nEvaluate model reliability: If a species constantly has low confidence scores, maybe I shouldn‚Äôt treat its detection as trustworthy without more evidence.\nSpot detection bias: Some birds might be misidentified due to overlapping frequencies with other species. A wide range of scores might indicate this.\nTailor my alerts and filtering: I might only log or act on detections with a confidence &gt; 0.85 for certain species. Others, I might review manually."

    "text": "The original presentation of what we know as Boyle‚Äôs law has several interesting features. First, the technical difficulties of the experiment were considerable, because Boyle used a glass tube full of mercury that was nearly 2.5 m long, and the large pressures sometimes shattered the glass. Next, Boyle‚Äôs table of results contains extremely awkward fractions, such 10/13, 2/17, 13/19, and 18/23, which look very strange to us today. This was because he calculated the pressure for a certain volume of gas by using simple multiplication and division, keeping the vulgar fractions. Boyle was not able to express the numbers as decimals because this notation was not in common use at the time. Finally, his contention that pressure and volume were inversely related depended on the reader‚Äôs comparing two sets of numbers in adjacent columns to see how well they agreed. Today we would plot the data, but again orthogonal graphs were not in general use in 1662. When Boyle‚Äôs data are plotted by using modern conventional methods, they strongly support his hypothesis that the volume and pressure of a gas are inversely related.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Boyles Results\n\n\nThe figure above shows the original table from his 1662 paper, New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Air: Whereunto is Added A Defence of the Authors Explication of the Experiments, Against the Obiections of Franciscus Linus, and, Thomas Hobbes. This was the second edition of a book of almost the same title which had been published two years earlier\nBoyle described the experiment in the text accompanying his table, shown in @ref(fig1)\nWith considerable difficulty, he procured a glass U tube, the longer leg of which was nearly 8 ft. (2.44 m) long, while the shorter leg was some 12 in. (30.5 cm) long and was sealed at the end. He then prepared a narrow piece of paper, on which he marked 12 in. and their quarters, and he placed this in the shorter limb. A similar piece of paper, again divided into inches and quarters, was placed in the longer limb. Holding the U tube vertically, he then poured mercury into the long limb so that a column of air 12 in. long was trapped in the short limb, and the mercury levels in the two limbs were initially the same. This was the situation represented by the top row of numbers in figure 1.\nHe then carefully added more mercury, little by little, to the long limb, and he observed the compression of the column of air in the short limb. For example, the second row of the second column of Fig. 1shows that he stopped adding mercury for the second set of readings when the length of the air column was 11 1/2 in.\nThe third column (B) shows that, at this time, the additional height of the mercury in the longer limb was 1 7/16 in. Additional mercury was then added until the air column was 11 in. high (row 3), at which time the additional height of the mercury in the long column was 2 13/16 in. Although the paper strip in the long limb was only divided into quarters of an inch, Boyle was able to interpolate and measure the height of the mercury to one-quarter of each small division (that is, 1/16 of an inch). In all, Boyle added mercury 24 times, until the length of the column of air was reduced to 3 in. (bottom row, second column A) and the additional height of the mercury was 88 7/16 in. (bottom row, column B).\nBoyle added some interesting details on how he carried out this experiment. He had trouble with the breaking of the glass tubes because of the high pressures developed by the long column of mercury, so the lower part of the tube was placed in a square wooden box. This allowed him to catch the valuable mercury. As indicated above, the mercury was poured in very slowly because, as Boyle noted, it was ‚Äúfar easier to pour in more, than to take out any, in case too much at once had been poured in.‚Äù The long tube was so tall that the experiment was carried out in a stairwell. Boyle also used a small mirror behind the tube to help him measure the height of the mercury accurately. (aside: this is a great A-level physics trick for reading scales accurately)\nAs indicated above, the second column of the table (A) and third column (B) show, respectively, the length of the trapped column of air and the additional height of the mercury in the long limb (both in inches). The first column of the table (also headed A) is simply the number of quarter-inches occupied by the trapped air. In other words, it is simply the second column multiplied by 4, and it is proportional to the volume of the gas (assuming a constant cross-sectional area of the tube). In the fourth column, headed C, Boyle states ‚Äúadded to 22 l/8.‚Äù This is actually a misprint. The correct value is 29 1/8 in., which Boyle took to be the height of a mercury column supported by the normal atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the fifth column (headed D) is the sum of column B and 29 1/8 in., except that all the fractions in column D are given in 16ths. This column shows the pressure to which the bubble of gas was subjected. The last column (E) is the calculated pressure for the volume shown in the first column (A) according to Boyle‚Äôs hypothesis that volume and pressure are inversely related. The fractions are difficult to read and are listed in the Fig. 1 legend.\nThere are interesting points about Boyle‚Äôs table. First, why did Boyle not convert the values to decimals rather than keep the very awkward fractions such as 15/19? As an example, it is not immediately clear to most of us to what extent 107 13/16 differs from 107 7/13. However, if we put these two numbers into a decimal format as 107.813 and 107.538, we can immediately see that the difference between the two is &lt;0.3%.\nThe explanation of why Boyle did not use decimal notation is that this was not in general use in 1662. Some notations that bear some resemblance to modern decimals can be found in ancient China and medieval Arabia. Simon Stevin (1548‚Äì1620) is often credited with the first use of decimals as we know them today, and these were introduced into England in about 1608. However, it was not until the 18th century that decimal notation become standardized, and, therefore, it is not surprising that Boyle did not make use of decimals.\nAnother surprising feature for the modern reader about Boyle‚Äôs treatment of his data is why he did not plot the results in a graph. One problem with the table shown in Fig. 1 is that the reader has to inspect each row of columns D and E to get a feeling for how much the observed pressures differed from the pressures calculated from the hypothesis. In addition, we need to compare the differences in the top rows with the bottom rows to see if the differences depend on the magnitude of the pressure or volume. Finally, we need to scan the table to make sure that the whole range of pressures/volumes is covered more or less uniformly - Again, the explanation for why Boyle did not plot his data in this way is that graphs to depict data were not in general use in 1662. For example, in ‚ÄúLa Geometrie‚Äù which Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1660) wrote as an appendix to his major work of 1637, few orthogonal coordinate systems are used for graphs. In fact, a number of the graphical methods for depicting data that we use today, such as pie charts, were not introduced until the 19th century.\nLets apply a modern treatment to his results:"

One problem with the table shown in Fig. 1 is that the reader has to inspect each row of columns D and E to get a feeling for how much the observed pressures differed from the pressures calculated from the hypothesis. In addition, we need to compare the differences in the top rows with the bottom rows to see if the differences depend on the magnitude of the pressure or volume. Finally, we need to scan the table to make sure that the whole range of pressures/volumes is covered more or less uniformly - Again, the explanation for why Boyle did not plot his data in this way is that graphs to depict data were not in general use in 1662. For example, in ‚ÄúLa Geometrie‚Äù which Ren√© Descartes (1596‚Äì1660) wrote as an appendix to his major work of 1637, few orthogonal coordinate systems are used for graphs. In fact, a number of the graphical methods for depicting data that we use today, such as pie charts, were not introduced until the 19th century.\nLets apply a modern treatment to his results:"
