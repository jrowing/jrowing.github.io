Hi, I'm Joe – a passionate educator, physics enthusiast, and lifelong learner. With years of experience teaching and leading sixth form education in the UK, I’ve recently embraced a new chapter: sharing my love of environment, science and learning internationally. Whether I'm in the classroom, training teachers, or experimenting with dataloggers, I’m all about making science engaging, accessible, and meaningful.\
When I’m not teaching, you’ll probably find me writing, exploring new cultures, or working on my latest education project. If you want to know more, have a look at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrowing/)
