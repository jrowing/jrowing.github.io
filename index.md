## Hello, nice to see you



Hi, I’m Joe – a passionate educator, physics enthusiast, and lifelong learner. With years of experience teaching and leading sixth form education in the UK, I’ve recently embraced a new chapter: sharing my love of environment, science and learning internationally. Whether I’m in the classroom, training teachers, or experimenting with dataloggers, I’m all about making science engaging, accessible, and meaningful.
When I’m not teaching, you’ll probably find me writing, exploring new cultures, or working on my latest education project. If you want to know more about me professionally, have a look at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrowing/).



More informally I am a generalist, always with some projects on the go. I have tried to maintain blogs and the like for years but there's always something more interesting going on. I have vague hopes that this format for my personal site will stick for a while.  I am moving my collection of thoughts on education and physics teaching over to [Substack, where I will have a whole host of resources and interesting bits of geekery for you.](https://jrowing.substack.com)
