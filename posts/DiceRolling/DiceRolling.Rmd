Each die in this experiment represents a radioactive nucleus. On every "roll" (i.e., time step), each die has a fixed probability \( p = \frac{1}{6} \) of decaying (being removed). We begin with 80 dice.

This setup mimics **radioactive decay**, where:
- The probability of a single atom decaying per unit time is constant.
- The number of undecayed atoms decreases over time.

```{r}
# Required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Parameters
P0 <- 80
n_rolls <- 50
p <- 1 / 6

# Simulation
pop_avg <- numeric(n_rolls + 1)
set.seed(NULL)

P <- P0
pop_avg[1] <- P0
k <- 1
while (k <= n_rolls && P > 0) {
  r <- rbinom(1, P, p)
  P <- P - r
  pop_avg[k + 1] <- P
  k <- k + 1
}

# Truncate data when population hits zero
final_index <- which(pop_avg == 0)[1]
if (is.na(final_index)) {
  final_index <- length(pop_avg)
}
pop_avg <- pop_avg[1:final_index]
time <- 0:(length(pop_avg) - 1)

# Exponential decay model
lambda <- -log(1 - p)
exp_model <- P0 * exp(-lambda * time)

# Geometric approximation
geometric_expansion <- function(t, p, P0, n_terms = 15) {
  sapply(t, function(tt) {
    sum(sapply(0:(n_terms - 1), function(k) {
      coef <- (-1)^k * choose(tt, k)
      coef * p^k
    })) * P0
  })
}
geom_approx <- geometric_expansion(time, p, P0, n_terms = 15)

# Half-life
t_half <- log(2) / lambda

# Combine data
df <- data.frame(
  Roll = time,
  Experimental = pop_avg,
  Exponential = exp_model,
  Geometric = geom_approx
)

## What‚Äôs Plotted?

The graph shows three curves:

### 1. Experimental (Simulated) Line
- This line shows the actual number of dice remaining after each roll in a single experiment.
- It's jagged because it's **random**: on each roll, a different number of dice decay.

### 2. Exponential Decay Line (Continuous Model)
- This is the smooth curve you'd get if decay happened continuously (instead of once per roll).
- It's based on the exponential decay formula:  
  \[
  N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}, \quad \lambda = -\ln(1 - p)
  \]
- This is often taught as the **theoretical decay law** in physics.

> üîç This curve smooths out randomness and assumes infinitesimally small time steps ‚Äî great for math, but not realistic for real-world random events.

### 3. Geometric Expansion Line (Dashed)
- This is a **series approximation** of the geometric decay:  
  \[
  N(t) = N_0 (1 - p)^t
  \]
- The series is built using the **binomial expansion** of \( (1 - p)^t \), and you‚Äôve included 15 terms for good accuracy even at early times.
- This curve lies right on top of the exponential line for small \( t \), showing they‚Äôre nearly equivalent at first.


## What the Graph Shows You

- **Agreement at Early Times:** All three lines start at the same place and follow a similar shape, showing how well the continuous exponential model approximates the actual discrete decay early on.
- **Divergence Through Randomness:** The experimental line starts to diverge due to the random nature of decay (especially in single trials).
- **Geometric vs Exponential:** The geometric expansion sits between the raw simulation and the smooth exponential, acting as a bridge between theory and simulation.



## Physics Context

This graph is a perfect classroom tool to:
- Introduce **exponential decay** and how it's derived.
- Highlight the assumptions behind the exponential model (e.g., continuous time).
- Show how **probabilistic events lead to deterministic laws** when averaged or modeled.
- Provide a **critical look at models** ‚Äî the "perfect curve" doesn‚Äôt represent any single real-world trial, but rather an average over many.
