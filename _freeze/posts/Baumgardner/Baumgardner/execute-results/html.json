During his descent, he accelerated rapidly, eventually breaking the sound barrier before safely deploying his parachute.\n\n<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E9oKEJ1pXPw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\n\n</iframe>\n\nIn this activity, you'll use a computational model to simulate the physics of such a jump. By combining Newton’s laws of motion with the effects of air resistance and changing air density, you'll explore how forces interact during freefall from high altitudes.\n\nYou’ll investigate how the jumper’s velocity and acceleration change over time and identify the key point where drag balances gravity—known as terminal velocity. You’ll also reflect on the limitations of the model and how we can improve its accuracy.\n\nBy the end, you'll have a better understanding of the complex yet fascinating dynamics of extreme skydiving—and how physics helps us make sense of them.\n\n## Modelling the jump:\n\nThe problem can be simply described in a free-body diagram:\n\n![](images/clipboard-3825701660.png){width=\"234\"}\n\nDuring his free-fall, he was subject to two main forces: gravity\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{F_g} = mg;\n$$\n\nand atmospheric drag\\\n$$\n\\mathbf{F_d} = -C \\rho(h) A |\\mathbf{v}|^2 \\hat{v}\n$$\n\nWhere the drag coefficient $$C \\rho(h) A$$ is composed of a constant $$ C $$ depending on the shape of the object, the air density $$ \\rho(h) $$ which depends on the height with respect to sea level, and the surface area perpendicular to the direction of motion$ A $.\n\nAssume that Baumgartner + equipment have a mass of 120kg, and that we are on Earth (so $|\\mathbf{g}| = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$).\n\nWe can model the density of the atmosphere as a decaying exponential function:\n\n$$\n\\rho(h) = \\rho_0 e^{-h/H_n}\n$$\n\nwhere $$H_n = 10,400$$ m and $$ \\rho{_0} = 1.2 kg/m³.$$\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n# Parameters\nmass <- 120      # kg\nmassuncert <- 1  # kg\ng <- 9.81        # m/s^2\nc_1 <- 1.2       # Drag coefficient\nrho_0 <- 1.2     # Fluid density at sea level\nh_n <- 10400     # Scale height\narea <- 1        # Cross-sectional area\ndt <- 0.01       # Time step\nt <- seq(0, 600, by = dt)\n\n# Initialize vectors\nx <- numeric(length(t))\nv <- numeric(length(t))\na <- numeric(length(t))\nrho <- numeric(length(t))\n\n# Initial conditions\nx[1] <- 39000\nv[1] <- 0\na[1] <- -g\n\n# Time stepping loop\nfor (i in 2:length(t)) {\n  rho[i] <- rho_0 * exp(-x[i - 1] / h_n)\n  a[i] <- -g + c_1 * rho[i] * area * (v[i - 1]^2) / mass\n  v[i] <- v[i - 1] + a[i - 1] * dt\n  x[i] <- x[i - 1] + v[i - 1] * dt\n}\n\n# Create data frame for plotting\ndf <- data.frame(time = t, altitude = x, velocity = v, acceleration = a)\n\n# Plot using ggplot2\np1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = altitude)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(y = \"Altitude (m)\", x = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = velocity)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(y = \"Velocity (m/s)\", x = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np3 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = acceleration)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(y = \"Acceleration (m/s^2)\", x = \"Time (s)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Combine plots\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Baumgardner_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
